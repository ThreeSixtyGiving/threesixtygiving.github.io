# 360 Giving Tools

A number of tools are under development to work with 360 Giving data.

## 360 Bridge

The 360 Bridge tool is currently under development as a fork of the [flattening-ocds tool](http://github.com/open-contracting/flattening-ocds). 

It can:

* Convert between Spreadsheet and JSON 360 Giving Files
* Generate templates based on the 360 Giving Schema

It is currently available as a python command line script. 

You can [fetch the latest copy from GitHub](http://github.com/open-contracting/flattening-ocds). Some basic details of use with 360 Giving are provided towards the bottom of the Readme file. 

A web service version may be available in future.
