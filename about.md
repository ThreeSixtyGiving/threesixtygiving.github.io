The 360 Giving Data Standard provides a way to publish grant information in a clear and re-usable format as open data on the web. 

It has been developed by the **[360 Giving Campaign](http://www.threesixtygiving.org)**: a collaborative project founded by <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/wperrin">William</a> and <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/franperrin">Fran Perrin</a> of <a href="http://indigotrust.org.uk/">The Indigo Trust</a> and is now run by a consortium of [Indigo Trust](http://www.indigotrust.org.uk), [Nominet Trust](http://www.nominettrust.org.uk), [Dulverton Trust](http://www.dulverton.org/), [BIG Lottery](http://www.biglotteryfund.org.uk) and [NESTA](http://www.nesta.org.uk).

This site currently hosts **Version 1.0** of the standard, along with guidance for publishers and users.
