## Technical support 

Support is available to help UK based trusts, foundations and philanthropists publish their data in the 360 Giving format, and to make use of published data. 

Our friendly team are on hand to answer your questions, or offer step-by-step support for new and existing publishers.

To get in touch, drop an e-mail to <a href="mailto:support@threesixtygiving.org">support@threesixtygiving.org</a> with details of your questions or needs, and we will get right back to you.

## Community mailing list

You can find a [community mailing list on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/group/360-discuss). We encourage anyone with an interest in changes to the standard, new datasets published, and discussing more advanced issues of data publication to join the list.
