Guidance on how to publish your own data.



## Choose your file type

The 360G Standard describes:

1. The important fields of information to provide about your grants, and how to publish these for others to re-use;
2. How to record this data in open data files;

Because different publishers and users have different needs, we provide three options for publishing and consuming data:

### (1) Summary table

For cases where you only want to publish or use headline information about grants you can use the summary table.

All the information on each grant is held on a single table row.

Summary tables can be saved in the widely used CSV format.

### (2) Multi-table

For cases where your data on each grant cannot easily fit into flat fields in a single table row, you can make use of the detailed multi-table format.

For example, if you have:

* Multiple documents, images and photos to publish for a particular grant;
* Detailed classification of a grant (for example, grants which are classified as both 'sports' and 'community development');
* Information (e.g. dates, amounts) about each of the payments made to a grantee (transactions); 
* Multiple beneficiary locations for a particular grant;

and you are most comfortable working with data in spreadsheet tools, such as [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/), [Excel](https://products.office.com/excel), or [OpenOffice Calc](http://www.openoffice.org/product/calc.html) then the multi-sheet format will be appropriate.

In this format, you can record extra information, and one-to-many relationships (e.g. one grant, many documents) in linked tables/worksheets.

### (3) Developers JSON

Developers building web applications with 360 Giving Data, or publishers who are exporting structured data directly from their databases, can make use of the JSON representation of 360 Giving data.

Tools are provided to help convert between summary table, multi-table and JSON formats.
